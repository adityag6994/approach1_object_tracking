In the Readme file for PMD Picoflexx Camera:
For Linux : Please extract the Linux package (will result in a “libroyale-3.15.0.X-LINUX-x86-64Bit” or
“libroyale-3.15.0.X-LINUX-x86-32Bit” folder). Then transfer the complete folder to your com-
puter.
Make sure that you have proper permissions to the USB device. The installation package
contains a proper rules file which can be used. It is located in the /driver/udev directory,
please refer to the README file in that directory for more details.

So we'll do as instructed,
Go to ../libroyale-3.15.0.50-LINUX-x86-64Bit/driver/udev and do as instructed in README:
From the ../libroyale-3.15.0.50-LINUX-x86-64Bit/driver/udev folder run the command: sudo cp 10-royale-ubuntu.rules /etc/udev/rules.d

Check if camera is working:
Go to ../libroyale-3.15.0.50-LINUX-x86-64Bit/bin and run the following command in terminal : ./royaleviewer.sh
Note: Please note that libroyale version 3.8 perfectly works for Ubuntu 14. I faced some problems with libroyale version 3.11
(which is the latest), hence I would reccommend to use libroyale version 3.8 if you are using Ubuntu 14.
